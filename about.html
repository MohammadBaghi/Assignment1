    My name is Mohammad Baghi. I'm a college student at Centennial college. I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran. <br>
    I have a bachelor degree in civil engineering which is not related to my courses right now. <br>
    I am passionate about programming, and right now, my love for it is at an all-time high. The thrill of solving complex problems,<br>
     the satisfaction of seeing my code come to life, and the endless possibilities of creating something new drive my enthusiasm.<br>
      Whether it's designing algorithms, crafting elegant code structures, or diving into the latest technologies, I find immense joy<br>
       in every aspect of programming. The constant learning and growth in this ever-evolving field only fuel my love for programming further,<br>
        and I am excited to continue exploring and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve.
